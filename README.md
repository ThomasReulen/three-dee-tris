# three-dee-tris
a 3d building block game written in three.js 

This as a project I did several years ago (around 2015) to learn and dig into Web GL with three.js. 

This is no commercial project, just for learning purpose.

For now I just uploaded it "as is", will refactor this in the future and update to new versions and a modern build system.
